  description:'Tea Time was my first ever react app and maybe the most revealing, so far, of who I am as an individual. Tea Time was built to help users perfect their tea experience by keeping a log of brew times and ratings. The app\'s main feature is a timer page that also tracks user activity. When a user leaves the Tea Time app by clicking another tab or closing the window while the timer is still running they will discover a spilled virtual cup upon their return üòû. I think we can all benefit from a nice break from the endless tabs and buzz of the interwebs, this is a cute tool to do it and enjoy your tea üíñ.',
