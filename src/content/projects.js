  title:'Tea Time',
  description:'Tea Time was my first ever react app and maybe the most revealing, so far, of who I am as an individual. Tea Time was built to help users perfect their tea experience by keeping a log of brew times and ratings. The app\'s main feature is a timer page that also tracks user activity. When a user leaves the Tea Time app by clicking another tab or closing the window while the timer is still running they will discover a spilled virtual cup upon their return üòû. I think we can all benefit from a nice break from the endless tabs and buzz of the interwebs, this is a cute tool to do it and enjoy your tea üíñ.',

    alt: 'a young Jung, artfully displayed in colorful digital painting',
    description: "I'm a big fan of recording dreams and developing an understanding of what's happening under the surface. I've been logging my own dreams for months now and my dream life has only become more vivid and meaningful. Between Dreams is my first mobile app. The goal is to bring a social element into the way we experience and interpret dreams, which I believe are as much about the collective as they are about the individual. With Between Dreams users can expect the following: a clean interface for logging, a way to create tags of trackable keywords, and a semi-anonymous way to share, view, and discuss dream logs amongst friends you add to your collective, and some resources to Jungian dream theory",
