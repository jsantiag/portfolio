  concept: "I'm a big fan of recording dreams and developing an understanding of what's happening under the surface. I've been logging my own dreams for months now and my dream life has only become more vivid and meaningful. Between Dreams is my first mobile app. The goal is to bring a social element into the way we experience and interpret dreams, which I believe are as much about the collective as they are about the individual. With Between Dreams users can expect the following: a clean interface for logging, a way to create tags of trackable keywords, and a semi-anonymous way to share, view, and discuss dream logs amongst friends you add to your collective, and some resources to Jungian dream theory",
