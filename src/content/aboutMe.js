  aboutMe:'I found my way to programming as a studio art major my senior year at Wellesley (CO \'18). I\'ve always had a thing for making experiences for people, that was the draw in my practice in studio and that was the primary drive for taking the steps to become a developer post grad. I joined Thinkful\'s full stack engineering immersion program and have not looked back. In the past six months I\'ve learned to build applications from the ground up and worked with many great people, some of whom you\'ll meet below. I look forward to forging my careerpath as a developer, keeping the goal of crafting better user experiences close as my guide through all that lies ahead. Take a look at some of my projects or drop me a line below.'
